For support legacy browsers (MSIE 7, MSIE 8), use jquery-1.x.x.min.js
For support modern browsers and environments from MSIE9 forward, use jquery-3.x.x.min.js

There are two versions of Migrate. 

* jquery-migrate-1.x.x.min.js will help you update your pre-1.9 jQuery code to jQuery 1.9 up to 3.0

* jquery-migrate-3.x.x.min.js helps you update code to run on jQuery 3.0 or higher, once you have used Migrate 1.x and upgraded to jQuery 1.9 or higher
